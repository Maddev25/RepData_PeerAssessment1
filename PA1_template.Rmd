## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r echo = TRUE}

## Load the Data
if(!file.exists('activity.csv')) {
  unzip('activity.zip')
}
 
actData <- read.csv("activity.csv")
summary(actData)

## Preprocess the Data for formatting the date fields
actData$date = as.Date(actData$date)

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo = TRUE}

## Loadneeded R packages 
library(dplyr)

## Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
s1 <- group_by (actData, date)
stepsperday <- summarize(s1, stepsTotal = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
print(stepsperday)

## If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(stepsperday$stepsTotal, main = "Histogram of Steps Per Day", xlab = "Total Steps per day")

## Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
medianStepsperday <- median(stepsperday$stepsTotal)
meanStepsperday <- mean(stepsperday$stepsTotal)

## Median Steps per day 
print(medianStepsperday)

## Mean Steps per day 
print(meanStepsperday)

```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}




```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
